# SPT Lua

:::warning Incomplete
SPT Lua as it stands if not complete, and the documentation is also still very much a work in progress. If you are seeing this,
it's purely just to give you an idea of what's to come, and to get feedback on the current state of the documentation.
:::

SPT Lua gives access to the Lua scripting language in Portal. This was originally being developed as an independent plugin
called "vlua" by [ChrisUMB](https://github.com/ChrisUMB/) and [Tom](https://github.com/timtomtim7/). The plugin was used
to create the [latest Glitchless TAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQsHq6vshOA), and when public interest in the plugin
increased, it was decided to merge it into SPT.

:::caution Not Yet In SPT
As it stands, SPT Lua is still in development, and is not yet officially integrated into SPT. However, if you are interested in
testing it, you can download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/ChrisUMB/SourcePauseTool-vlua/releases) page on the GitHub fork of SPT.
:::

## Uses

SPT Lua provides a number of different ways to interact with the game. You can print to the console, change the player's
position, get information about entities, listen to game events like `player_touch_trigger`, `player_teleport`, and more.
You can even modify the game's memory directly, allowing you to test hooks and memory manipulation without having to
set up a plugin development environment.

## Getting Started

### Commands

- `spt_lua_run <path>` - Runs the Lua file at the given path.
- `spt_lua_reset` - Resets the Lua environment.

### Folder Structure

Once you have downloaded the latest version of SPT and loaded it, there will be a new folder in your Portal directory
called `lua`. This folder contains useful assets, like auto generated documentation, a `libraries` folder which will
be useful later, and a `scripts` folder where you can put your own Lua scripts.


### Your First Script

To get started, create a new file in the `scripts` folder called `hello_world.lua`. Open the file in your favorite text
editor.

:::tip Visual Studio Code
The [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor has a number of useful extensions for Lua development.
SPT Lua contains Lua documentation powered by [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server), which
you can get as an extension for VS Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua).
:::

```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/hello_world.lua"
console.msg("Hello, world!")
console.warning("Hello, world, but in red!")
```

Save the file, then go back to Portal. Open the console and run `spt_lua_run hello_world`. You should see
```
Hello, world!
Hello, world, but in red!
```
printed to the console.

### Libraries

SPT Lua supports loading libraries from the `lua/libraries` folder. This is useful for sharing code between scripts.
One such library that you might have heard about before is [tas.lua](https://github.com/ChrisUMB/portal-lua-tas).

To use a library, download it and place it in the `lua/libraries` folder. Then, in your script, use the `require`
function to load it.

```lua title="portal/lua/libraries/example_library.lua"
local example_library = {}

function example_library.hello_world()
    console.msg("Hello, world!")
end

return example_library
```

```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/tas_example.lua"
local example_library = require("example_library")

example_library.hello_world()
```
