# Glitchless

Glitchless is the most popular of the five main categories, and is commonly regarded as more
beginner-friendly, as it doesn't require learning any complex glitches. Despite what the name suggests, there are
a lot of debates about what is and isn't allowed in glitchless, and the rules are subject to change.

There are a number of tricks that are still frequently debated, but are currently allowed in glitchless, such as:
- [19 Pipe Shot](https://youtu.be/5FFDigrNDDM?t=213)
- Reportal
